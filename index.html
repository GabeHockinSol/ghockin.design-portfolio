		<div class="inner">
			<p>When researching logos, I initially looked at big companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, etc and
				tried to break down what made their designs iconic. From what I discovered the key rules a lot of
				successful company’s use is that a logo should have properties of scalability, simplicity, and a
				simplistic colour scheme.
				I studied several articles however an article by (Inkbot Design, 2019) came up with a lot of very key
				points. In this specific article about logo design they go on to explain how a logo is vital part to a
				business and how colour, creativity and curiosity is crucial to a logo.
				When discussing Apple’s logo (Inkbot, Design 2019) “Us humans love ourselves a little mystery, and if
				you can get people to look at your logo for longer, you capture their attention, and it will linger in
				their memory.” This quote helped me understand how companies like Apple changed from their original logo
				design to something simpler and more mysteries to capture people’s attention and draw them into their
				business. </p>

			<p>(Inkbot Design, 2019) Draws attention to Coca Cola’s logo and expresses how colour is used.
				“A strong logo works in black and white too, for instance when it’s reproduced in monochrome for print”.
				This statement confidently explains that when designing a logo a designer must consider every aspect of
				how the logo will be displayed. I found this information extremely necessary for when planning my logo
				and visual identity style guide.</p>

			<p>Since my portfolio is about branding myself as a web developer, I researched digital designer/ web
				developer logos and websites to get an understanding of how they went around their design. A good
				example was the programming language Python and how the company (Python Software Foundation, 2020) used
				two snakes as their logo to represent not only the name of their software but also a unique way to
				market their product as most programming languages are very bland in design. </p>

				<h2>Visual Identity Style Guide</h2>
			</header>
		</div>
		<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/work/NetflixVISG.PNG" alt="" /></a>
		<div class=" inner">
			<p>When designing my portfolio I needed to keep a theme and as discussed previously I would like to keep a
				minimalist and programming theme to help keep my work easily consistent in design.
				I will also be considering about publishing my work to social media and how important it is to keep a
				theme and iconic style to my work.
				<br></br>
				A Visual Identity Style Guide (VISG) is crucial to almost every design project as it helps keep the
				design workflow and theme of the project consistent. It is especially important when working in teams
				and helps document how the project should look.
				<br></br>
				Before designing my Visual Identity Style Guide, I first studied multiple companies’ approaches to their
				designs such as Spotify, The London Underground and Netflix. Netflix’s Visual Style Guide has a unique
				format which is something I have taken inspiration from. For example, Netflix highlights multiple rules
				in where the company logo can and cannot be displayed. They also state the colour scheme and clearing
				space which helps promote the logo so that it always stands out and reminds eye catching to the
				audience.

	<article class="container box style3">
		<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/work/VISGDrawn.jpg" alt="" /></a>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>When making my VISG I broke it down into sections and thought about what I will need for my portfolio. A
				simple example of this is to cover Typography, Colour Scheme, Clearing Space, Logo Design, Text example
				and what to avoid. With these core elements put in place it would help me keep my portfolio and future
				work consistent in design. <br></br>After designing an overall template of my VISG I then imported it in
				to photoshop and created a digital copy. This helped me understand how my theme would look on a digital
				device and had extra advantages such as adding colour scheme properties next to my colours and adding
				notes to certain areas such as, Typography uses the font (“Sakbunderan” 1001 fonts, 2019).
				I also added a few rules such as only using the font in a regular format and not Italics or Bold as this
				made the design of the font not as appealing. By adding these rules to my VISG it helps keep my design
				workflow consistent and efficient.

		<div class="inner">
			<p>When designing my Business card, I had to keep my layout of the card scalable and following the brief I
				made all my designs 85mm x 55mm. I researched various layouts. Since my theme is minimalistic, I needed
				to focus on keeping my design simple. When researching what goes on a business card, I discovered that a
				lot designs can be to complex and hard to read. They also focus on sharing the persons contact
				information as the most important thing on the card.
				Following the style set out by my VISG I proceeded to design my business card. In the brief it states
				that my design must be 85mm x 55mm which I took into consideration when in development.
				I also studied trending business themes and how the designs have changed over time.</p>

			<p>
				An example of minimalistic design which I studied was from an article by (“Hoban Cards, 2019”) in which
				they discuss the curious nature of business cards used in the film “American Psycho”.
				(“Hoban Cards, 2019”) “The layout has a professional, familiar feel to it and is well suited in a
				variety of industries.” This simplistic yet efficient design helped me consider different options and
				add a more modern theme to my design by incorporating elements of styles used in past decades. </p>

		<div class="inner">
			<p>In my design I try and incorporate a simplistic and basic colour scheme to make the logo professional and
				not complex. In the design I use multiple symbols to represent the fundamentals of my work. For example,
				the greater/less than and forward dash symbols represent programming. The underscore represents the
				client I would be working with. My reasoning behind this was to add a level of depth to my creativity
				and make it seem like the underscore was implying that this should be you i.e. the client. Furthermore,
				this is the reasoning for having my initials before the forward dash, so the logo is essentially reading
				“Programmer Gabe Hockin working with Client”. I also changed the font from my initial design to give it
				a more algorithmic design, once again suggesting a programmer job title.</p>

		<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/work/AppleDesign1.PNG" alt="" /></a>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>When designing my portfolio page for git hub and Adobe Portfolio I took inspiration from already trending
				companies/ websites such as Apple as they have a similar style to what my theme is. Apple’s layout of
				their website is clearly on purpose and is clever in how they promote their products by making them the
				forefront of the website and trying to sell their products straight away.
				This design philosophy works perfectly with my portfolio as my social media and website should be
				showcasing my work and try to draw in consumers.
				<br></br>
				I also researched Adobe Portfolio themes and was drawn in by the “Ludwig Theme” for its simplistic
				design. When testing the theme, I was intrigued by how the page was laid out and started to sketch out
				rough ideas of how I could present my work. I was also inspired by the navigation of the website and how
				it was simple to access different pages and linked social media.
				<br></br>
				By using buttons that the user can press to navigate up and down the website makes navigation simple,
				efficient and scale correctly when using different devices. At the bottom of my Git hub page I also link
				my Adobe Portfolio page for people to follow as well as a social media menu to promote my work.

			<p>When designing my web pages, I thought about how to display my work and how it would scale on different
				devices. In my designs I drew a layout of the fundamentals of where each function should be. For
				example, the title, header, footer, work, social media and how transitions between my git hub page and
				Adobe Portfolio page would perform. As a result of this I looked at html5 themes and took inspiration
				from how people can navigate around a website.</p>

		<div class="inner">
			<p>Conclusion
				In conclusion I have learned a lot about logo design and the importance of how to brand myself. Learning
				to use visual identity style guides has helped me a lot to keep a theme throughout my work and helped me
				understand how a colour scheme and scaling is a crucial part of design.
				I also learned the importance of how planning my work thoroughly before starting development as this
				helped me keep track of my work.
				Although I may have encountered some issues along the way such as the font style on Adobe Portfolio
				forcing me to use a certain type of font, I learned to comprise my design on and make the website fit
				the visual aesthetic. Going forward I plan to keep building on my Portfolio page and design a blog for
				my university/ personal work, so I can build a following on social media and keep track of my work.
